## Accompanying website for VARIATIONAL TIMBRE DYNAMICS MODEL FOR GENERATION OF MUSICAL SOUNDS

Github pages with audio examples and explanations: https://hyakuchiki.github.io/timbredynamicswebpage/

Raw audio files and spectrograms are under `resources/`.

Source code of the programs used in the paper is under `code/`. We use an original pytorch port of the original [DDSP](https://github.com/magenta/ddsp) for differentiable synthesis. Code may be edited later with more explanations and organized for better clarity.
